# Klaustoons 
### Escape Reality

---

This is the launch website for Klaustoons. A comic-reader web-app built with the aim to undo the marginalization of Art in Sub-Saharan Africa. It allows its users to upload various comics and engage with the readers via communities. 
This is a step to allow people from everywhere to create and engage with stories that stem or are derived, from Africa, its culture and heritage.

This site handles the sign up and notification logic for the people who want to be informed when Klaustoons shall be launched. It is a basic overview of who we are, what we stand for and are trying to achieve.
