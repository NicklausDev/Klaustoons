# Klaustoons 
### Escape Reality

---

This is a comic-reader web-app built with the aim to undo the marginalization of Art in Sub-Saharan Africa. It allows its users to upload various comics and engage with the readers via communities. 
This is a step to allow people from everywhere to create and engage with stories that stem or are derived, from Africa, its culture and heritage.
